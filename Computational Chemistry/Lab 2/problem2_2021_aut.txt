
(a) Write a single code with options to calculate pairwise interaction
    potential energy as a function of distance 'r' (V(r)) with a width 'dr' for
      1) Square-well potential (with lambda = 2)
      2) Soft-sphere potential (with neu = 1 and 10)
      3) 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential

    Submit the code.

(b) Using the code calculate V(r) for all the three potential forms, 
    for liquid argon (sigma = 3.4 Angs, and epsilon = 1 kJ/mol), by varying 
    the distance between the pairs from 3 to 15 Angstroms with an width 
    dr=0.5 Angstrom.

    Plot the results for each potential form. In the plots use a maximum 
    cut-off in V(r) at 2 kJ/mol.

    Submit the graphs.
