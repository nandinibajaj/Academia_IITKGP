Application of periodic boundary conditions (PBC)
-------------------------------------------------

Consider the attached file (model.txt) containing the coordinates of 
216 monatomic molecules distributed randomly in a cubic cell 
of dimension 18.64 Angs (origin being at the center).

(a) Use PBC and develop a code to apply an uniform displacement of 1 Ang 
magnitude on each of the molecules along either x, y, or z axis chosen 
randomly. The direction of the displacement (along +ve or -ve) should also 
be decided randomly.

(b) Following the conditions as mentioned in (a), carry out 20 successive
iterations on the supplied data.

(c) Count and report the number of molecules experienced PBC in every iteration.

(d) Report the coordinates generated after 5th, 10th, and 20th iterations.
 
Submit the code and the outputs of (c) and (d).
