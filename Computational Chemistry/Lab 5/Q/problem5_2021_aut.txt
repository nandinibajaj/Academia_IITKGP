
The attached data file (argon_coord_05.txt) contains the coordinates of 
365 Argon atoms in liquid state as obtained from 5 successive MD steps 
of a simulation in a cubic cell of dimension 26 Angs. The interaction 
between the Ar atoms can be described by pairwise 12-6 Lennard-Jones 
potential form, the parameters of which are given below.

Modify the code developed for solving Problem 4 to calculate

(a) The total pairwise potential energy (V) of the system in each of
the 5 configurations.

(b) The magnitude of force acting on each atom (|F|) in ONLY the 
1st configuration.


Required data:
-------------
sigma = 3.4 Angs.
epsilon = 1 kJ/mol.
cell dimension (L) = 26 Angs.
Cut-off radius(r_c) = 10 Angs.

Hints and important points:
--------------------------
(1) PBC, minimum image conventions and cut-off sphere have to be implemented.
(2) V should be reported in kJ/mol unit.
(3) Force should be reported in kg*Angs/fs^2 unit 
(4) Derive and implement the expression of force for shifted-force LJ model 
in the code.
